By mzone (@mzone on discord)

Hint :

If you wound up on another (unrelated) discord server,
then one of the sites you visited is too new.

As we already used the youtube channel, the mastodon and the twitter of Cole Minerton, the only social network that we didn’t use is Reddit :

[](https://old.reddit.com/user/coleminerton)

As we can read in the URL name, the site is the old reddit of Cole, we can read a post named : “It sucks having a new account” and an other post named :”New mod of r/tinyislandsurvival”

So let’s watch the **old** [r/tinyislandsurvival](https://old.reddit.com/r/tinyislandsurvival/) subreddit ! 

There is nothing really important except we can go to the [Wiki Tiny Island](https://tiny-island-survival.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny_Island_Survival_Wiki)

On this site we can go to the history and we can find the IP adress of Cole :

![Untitled](Osint%203%20a63b0c49b39c4230a8bf1a00d82dc018/Untitled.png)

Special mention : 

To understand the hint we have to go on the “recent” [r/tinyislandsurvival](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyislandsurvival/) and in the description of the subreddit we have a Discord server : [https://discord.gg/HtfmrHmKys](https://discord.gg/HtfmrHmKys)

But if we read the hint, we understand that’s it’s in the description of the subreddit but in the old reddit.
